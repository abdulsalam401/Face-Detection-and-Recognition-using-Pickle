# Face Detection and Recognition using Pickle

A Python-based AI project that detects and recognizes human faces in real time using OpenCV and a serialized model with Pickle.

## ðŸŽ¯ Features
- Real-time face detection using webcam
- Train model with custom faces
- Store trained data using Pickle
- Recognize and identify known faces

## ðŸ§° Technologies Used
- Python
- OpenCV
- Pickle
- Numpy

## ðŸ“š Subject
Artificial Intelligence (AI)

## ðŸš€ How to Run
1. Install dependencies:  
   `pip install opencv-python numpy pickle5`   

2. Run `real_time_face_recognition_02.py` to capture your face and if you want to save your face in Pkl file just save your face with your name and when run again the programe show the register name with register faces
